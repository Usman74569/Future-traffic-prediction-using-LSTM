🚦 Traffic Volume Prediction

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates traffic analysis and prediction using Python, Data Visualization, and Machine Learning techniques.

The notebook explores real-world traffic patterns, applies data preprocessing, builds models, and visualizes results to gain insights into how traffic volume changes over time.
