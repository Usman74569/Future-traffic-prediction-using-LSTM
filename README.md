🚦 Traffic Volume Prediction (Colab Project)

This project analyzes and visualizes traffic volume data using Python in Google Colab. The dataset includes weather, time, and traffic features, and we explore patterns to understand how traffic varies across time and conditions.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains traffic data with features like weather, holidays, and time.
A sample:

holiday	temp	rain_1h	snow_1h	clouds_all	weather_main	weather_description	date_time	traffic_volume
None	288.28	0	0	40	Clouds	scattered clouds	10/2/2012 9:00	5545
None	289.36	0	0	75	Clouds	broken clouds	10/2/2012 10:00	4516
None	289.58	0	0	90	Clouds	overcast clouds	10/2/2012 11:00	4767
None	290.13	0	0	90	Clouds	overcast clouds	10/2/2012 12:00	5026
None	291.14	0	0	75	Clouds	broken clouds	10/2/2012 13:00	4918
🛠️ Features

✅ Data preprocessing and cleaning

✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

✅ Line graph: Traffic Volume vs Time

✅ Correlation analysis between weather and traffic

✅ Machine Learning (prediction of traffic volume)

✅ Visualization using Matplotlib & Seaborn

📊 Example Visualization

Traffic Volume vs Time (line graph)

🚀 How to Run

Open the notebook in Google Colab.

Upload the dataset (Metro_Interstate_Traffic_Volume.csv or similar).

Run all cells in order.

Graphs and results will be generated automatically.

📦 Requirements

The notebook installs all dependencies in Colab. If running locally, install:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

📌 Notes

This repo contains the full Colab notebook only.

No separate model files are uploaded.

Ideal for beginners learning about ML in traffic prediction and visualization.

👉 Would you like me to also include results screenshots (like EDA plots, ML predictions, etc.) in the README so your GitHub looks more professional?

no no give me good readme file withput
